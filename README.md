# EagleLibs
Assorted Eagle Libraries

Pixelblaze 3.4  component footprint library, for use with Autodesk Eagle.  I used version 9.6.2 to create it - I am unsure how far back reverse compatibility may extend.
The next revision of pixelblaze has the same main pin locations/identities, however the pads for additional GPIO access on the back of the pixelblaze changed.  
 - If you plan on using these new pads, you may need to adapt this component or come up with your own workaround.
